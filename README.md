# Ships

VIDEGROs Ships is an Android application which allows you to receive AIS information directly from ships in your neighbourhood using a cheap DVB-T-DAB-FM / RTL-SDR receiver.

IMPORTANT: You need to have an OTG capable Android device and a DVB-T-DAB-FM / RTL-SDR receiver, otherwise this application is useless.

It is an all in one application. This means that these 3 features are combined in one:
- Find the parts per million offset (PPM) of your DVB-T-DAB-FM receiver;
- Receive the AIS data from air;
- Plot ships data onto a map (or send it to another application).
